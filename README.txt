Mat's Super Awesome Math Utility Package 
===========

Mat's super awesome math utility package provides a single method to do standard deviation, poorly.  It's most useful if you are stuck on a deserted island with a computer that happens to have it installed, no internet connection, and for some reason want to know the standard deviation of the weights of the coconuts you have been collected (weighed, obviously by a scale that has luckily washed up on shore).  You are trying to find a relationship between weight and amount of coconut juice.

The fact that you are somehow powering this laptop is beyond the scope of this package.

A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
